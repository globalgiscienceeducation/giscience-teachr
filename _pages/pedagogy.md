## GIS&T Body of Knowledge

The [Geographic Information Science and Technology Body of Knowledge](https://gistbok.ucgis.org/) (GIS&T BoK) was developed by the [University Consortium for Geographic Information Science](https://www.ucgis.org/) to document the domain of geographic information science and its associated technologies.

As part of the [Programming and Development](https://gistbok.ucgis.org/knowledge-area/programming-and-development/info) category, the GIS&T BoK includes the topic [PD-15 - R for Geospatial Analysis and Mapping](https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-topics/r-geospatial-analysis-and-mapping), which provides a detailed introduction to R as a tool offering GIS functionalities. The page dedicated to the topic provides an overview of how vector and raster data are represented in R, as well as it's main geoprocessing, spatial statistics and mapping functionalities. The conclusions include a list of the main R libraries relevant for spatial analysis and mapping, and further references to books covering spatial data handling and analysis in R.
