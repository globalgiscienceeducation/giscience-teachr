## What is this about?

The disruptions of COVID-19 will have long long-lasting effects on teaching and learning at every level. As we figure this out, one day at a time, what knowledge can we gain from each other?  How can our experiences become opportunities for rethinking and revisioning our practices and perspectives? 

The [Global GIScience Education](https://www.globalgiscienceeducation.org) group has started a series of discussions about GIScience education, to foster global conversations about these truly global issues.

This repository aims to be a hub for those in the GIScience community who teach using R, providing best practices, guides, references to materials and a platform to discuss and develop new ideas.
